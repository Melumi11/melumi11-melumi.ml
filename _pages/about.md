I'm currently a student at UofM pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I enjoy creating software and solving puzzles.

Some other things I like include sushi, squirrels, and indie adventure games.

On my website you'll also find my [blog](/blog) posts and links to my Github repos. I write about cool stuff that I can't find anywhere else.
